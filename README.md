Claude v2 Chatbot Streamlit Application
=======================================

This application provides an interface to interact with the AWS Bedrock Claude chatbot using Streamlit.

Instructions:
-------------
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```
   pip install streamlit langchain boto3
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `claude_app.py` file.
4. Run the Streamlit application with the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run bedrock_claude.py
   ```

This should launch a web browser displaying the Streamlit interface for the Claude v2 chatbot. You can then interact with the chatbot directly from the web interface.

Note: Ensure you have the necessary credentials and configurations set up for the `langchain` package and the Claude v2 model.
